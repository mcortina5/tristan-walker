    <h1><center>Tristan Walker</center></h1>
    <h2><center>Walker is notably known for starting the company Walker & Co., which creates products for shaving and facial grooming for black men, by Bevel, as well as hair products for black women. He created these products for black people, to make sure their needs were provided for as he felt the world of health and beauty did not fully recognize or care for black people. He hopes there are more products for different hair types and skin types. <i>"Fast Company called Walker in a profile: [a] bold entrepreneur with a radical startup." The New York Times said that Walker "built a company for the demographic future." Fortune named him #19 in a list of the world's 50 greatest leaders in 2019. USA Today called Walker "the highest-profile African-American CEO and founder in Silicon Valley." Selected as Time's 100 Next, Time wrote that Walker "wants to build more than a company; he wants to build a legacy."</i></center></body></h2>
